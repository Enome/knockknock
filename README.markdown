# KnockKnock who's there?

A small validation framework for knockout that's who! ( this sounded funnier in my head ). 

Didn't know what to name it and Knockout.validation might be already taken.

#Run specs

Rather than testing it in the browser KnockKnock  is build with CommonJs modules and tested with Node.js and Jessie. 

First of all you need to have Node.js installed and npm. 

To install Jessie type:

    npm install -g jessie


You can now run tests by typing in the root dir.

    jessie spec 

Jessie is based on Jasmine BDD but adds some extra features and sugar.

#Build 

For now I am just compiling my CoffeeScript files into JavaScript onces. In the future I will create one file for easy usage.


#Usage

Check the example.html file to find out how to use KnockKnock.
